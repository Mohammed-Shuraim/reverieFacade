## 📱 About the Project

**Reverie Facade** is a mobile application designed to support individuals struggling with **Maladaptive Daydreaming (MaDD)** — a condition where excessive, immersive daydreaming interferes with real-life productivity and emotional balance.

This app empowers users with tools to **log, analyze, and understand** their daydreaming patterns over time. Through elegant interfaces, behavior-based reminders, and analytics-driven insights, it promotes mindful self-reflection and helps users regain control over their focus.

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Dream Analyzer** *(Upcoming)*
